================

Adjunct to Eclipse Orbit, this project's purpose is to package non-OSGI jars as OSGi bundles and publish them to an update site. 

This project's contents should never duplicate what's already in Eclipse Orbit; instead, it should provide newer versions of plugins already in Orbit, or plugins which cannot be included in Orbit for some reason (technical or otherwise).
